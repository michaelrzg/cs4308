Concepts of Programming Lang Section W01 Fall Semester 2024 
This is assignment is to implement the word count problem in Java. Specifically, the assignment is to create a program which counts the number of occurrences of each word in a text file.  The program requires are 
file name needs to be a command line argument 
appropriate error handling needs to be done 
do not consider character case when comparing words 
a generic (template) binary search tree needs to be used to store the words and their counts â€“ You will need to implement this tree. 
Each node in the tree will hold a word and a counter 
appropriate design principles need to be used
